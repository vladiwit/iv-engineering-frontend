    " - various types of solid fuels - peat, coal, coal waste, pellets, briquettes, firewood, wood materials, municipal solid waste, garbage, etc. with high humidity and ash content",
    " - allows you to work up to 3 days on one load of fuel (this characteristic may change in the range of 12-76 hours, depending on the type of fuel and thermal properties of the building)",
    " - precise adjustment of the temperature and power allows you to save up to 50% of fuel compared to using simple boilers with conventional combustion",
    " - can be included in the general heating system of the building",
    " - automatically controlled"

  "text2": "Due to the special combustion method, the equipment has the following advantages:",
  "content2": [
    " - energy-saving technologies, cheap heat in compliance with environmental standards, significant fuel savings compared to similar heat generators",
    " - fuel does not require preparation (i.e. fuel - unsorted!)",
    " - Incredible environmental performance - emissions close to the \"ideal fuel\" - natural gas (composition of CO in the exhaust gases is less than 1 g/m3 at an allowable rate for burning natural gas of 0.6 g/m3) - heat generators can be installed in urban areas"

  "text3": "Wood chips and pellets, which are organic waste, have the following advantages:",

  "content3": [
    " - availability due to low cost;",
    " - effective efficiency indicators due to the high calorific value;",
    " - virtually complete combustion",
    " - the absence of a large amount of emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere and soil"
