    "precise adjustment of the temperature and power of the boiler (increase and decrease) in manual mode and automatically using a room temperature controller, or a weather controller. Allows you to save up to 50% of fuel compared to using simple boilers with conventional combustion",
    "The set temperature of the coolant is automatically maintained: from 35 to 90 Â°C (20-50% of the operating time, the fuel in the boiler is in a state of smoldering) as a result of a longer period of operation at one load and the absence of fuel overburning)",
